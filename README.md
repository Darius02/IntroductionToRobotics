### Homework #3

Task Requirements: Using a joystick to control the position of the segment and ”draw” on the display.

The system has the following states:

  State 1: Current  position  blinking. Can use the joystick to move from one position to neighbours. Short pressing the button toggles State 2. Long pressing the       button in State 1 resets the entire display by turning all the segments OFF and moving the current position to the decimal point.
  
  State 2: The current segment stops blinking, adopting the state of the segment before selection (ON or OFF). Toggling the Y axis should change the segment state from   ON to OFF or from OFF to ON. Clicking the joystick should save the segment state and exit back to State 1.
